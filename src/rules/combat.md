## Flanking

Flanking is be a pseudo-condition that grants +2 bonus to melee attacks against the flanked target. Two allies are said to be flanking a creature if the allies are not incapacitated, on opposite sides of the creature, and adjacent to the creature. 

A creature with blindsight, tremorsense, or multiple heads cannot be flanked.

## Recharging Monster Abilities

For creatures with recharging abilities, such as a dragon's breath weapons, consider replacing recharge (5/6) with a simple timer, where number of turns between uses is determined by the recharge amount. Recharge 5/6 would correspond to one use every three turns. Recharge 6 would correspond to one use every six turns.

Additionally, such an effect would begin uncharged, as opposed to beginning in an already usable state as it is now.

This can be further leveraged by telegraphing to your players the turn before such a feature recharges. This can put more of an emphasis on proactive placement of players' characters, and make the fight more interactive.
