## Flanking

Flanking is be a pseudo-condition that grants +2 bonus to melee attacks against the flanked target. Two allies are said to be flanking a creature if the allies are not incapacitated, on opposite sides of the creature, and adjacent to the creature. 

A creature with blindsight, tremorsense, or multiple heads cannot be flanked.

## Actions in Combat

### Charge

When you take the Charge action, you gain the effects of the Dash action. If you end your movement closer to a creature than where you started, you can make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within your reach. If you make this attack, your turn ends immediately afterwards, and the next attack roll made against you before the start of your next turn has advantage.

> #### The Charger Feat
> 
> This action is intended to replace the Charger feat. The feat could be revised to enhance the Charge action in some way.

# DM Advice

## Recharging Monster Abilities

For creatures with recharging abilities, such as a dragon's breath weapons, consider replacing recharge (5/6) with a simple timer, where number of turns between uses is determined by the recharge amount. Recharge 5/6 would correspond to one use every three turns. Recharge 6 would correspond to one use every six turns.

Additionally, such an effect would begin uncharged, as opposed to beginning in an already usable state as it is now.

This can be further leveraged by telegraphing to your players the turn before such a feature recharges. This can put more of an emphasis on proactive placement of players' characters, and make the fight more interactive.
